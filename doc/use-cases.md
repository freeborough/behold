BEHOLD VTT: USE CASES
=====================

## Scenes

For TTRPGs it can be very useful to have more than one scene to use at a time:

* Dungeon Level 1 - The scene that the players are currently using, actively exploring a dungeon.
* Dungeon Level 2 - A scene that is currently hidden from the players, that the GM has preparred
  incase the players find a way down.
* World Map - A scene that's always available to players and shows a world map, where they are on
  it, and points of interest they've discovered.
* Quest Items - A scene that is made up of clues or parts of their quest, for the players to inspect
  and discuss - part of a time-worn map, a letter in some kind of code, an ornate key that must fit
  an ornate door.

## Layers

Having a scene broken up into different layers that render on top of each other allows pieces to be
moved on top of a board, of course, but it offers more than that by not limiting ourselves to just a
foreground and background layer:

* We can add extra immersion by breaking a map into background and foreground layers and having the
  character tokens between - this way characters can walk under some elements of the scene, like
  cobwebs, tree-tops, and so on.
* Provide alternative versions of maps such that they can dynamically change over the course of a
  game, for example a frozen lake that's cracking and breaking up.
* Have characters ride mounts or control vehicles, where the mount/vehicle appears on a layer below
  the characters, yet above the map.
* Effects that appear under characters but above the map, like fire or ooze, or effects that appear
  above characters, like smoke or rain.
