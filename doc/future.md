BEHOLD VTT: FUTURE
==================

Some notes for the future of the project - just a collection of ideas that come up as the current
phase is being developed.

## Project

### Text-Based Diagram Tools

Evaluate and pick a text-based diagram generator like PlantUML, Mermaid, etc.  They look like they'd
save a lot of time, have a really clear text-based representation and therefore work better with
version control diffs, and provide more consistency across diagrams.

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization Service

Evaluate and pick a self-hosted authentication & authorization service like Keycloak, it'll make it
quicker and easier to support more complex authentication patterns like OAuth.
